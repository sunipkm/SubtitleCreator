# Subtitle Creator/Editor using PyQt5
This is a modified version of the player example that comes with PyQt5. The program has been modified to support
subtitle (.srt) file creation with a (hopefully) self-explanatory UI.

### Note: Requires K-Light Codec Pack to be installed to play videos in the application.
