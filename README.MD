# Subtitle Creator/Editor using PyQt5
This is a modified version of the player example that comes with PyQt5. The program has been modified to support
subtitle (.srt) file creation with a (hopefully) self-explanatory UI.

Numpad (with NumLock enabled) is rewired to provide easy controls:
  5: Play/Pause
  4: pause and Step Backward (custom millisecond amount)
  6: Pause and Step Forward (custom millisecond amount)
  7: Mark current position as start
  9: Mark current position as end
  2: Add subtitle text at currently marked start and end positions to the queue

### Note: Requires K-Light Codec Pack to be installed to play videos in the application.
