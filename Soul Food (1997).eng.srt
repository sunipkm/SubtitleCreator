You'll find a gig soon.

675
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:48,375
You got a lot of confidence
just to be a little shorty.

676

from Big Mama, they say.

678
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,334
Here, throw these
in the glove box for me.

679
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:12,667
You know I spent some time
in prison, right?

680
00:37:14,834 --> 00:37:16,417
I wouldn't even
have been locked up

681
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,042
if I'd have been smart,
like you seem to be.

682
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:24,834
You know,

683
00:37:24,918 --> 00:37:27,417
Big Mama's always saying
you gotta love yourself.

684
00:37:29,459 --> 00:37:30,709
Maybe you should try that.

685
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:33,250
(CHUCKLES) My man.

686
00:37:42,751 --> 00:37:44,000
Well, it's getting late,

687
00:37:44,083 --> 00:37:46,334
and I still have
to grocery shop
for dinner tomorrow.

688

Okay.

689
00:37:49,292 --> 00:37:53,292
Max, surely,
you don't expect to have
Sunday dinner tomorrow.

690
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,125
Why not?

691
00:37:55,209 --> 00:37:57,459
Jesus, Max, Mama is in a coma.

692
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:59,209
Yeah I don't know, baby.
Maybe...

693
00:37:59,292 --> 00:38:02,667
No, no, no. I'm not
gonna let her ruin
a 40-year family tradition.

694
00:38:02,751 --> 00:38:05,292
Tradition?
Yes, tradition.

695
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:07,042
Don't you tell me
about tradition.

696
00:38:07,125 --> 00:38:09,542
I am the oldest one.
I am the responsible one.

697
00:38:09,626 --> 00:38:11,751
I am the one who graduated
from law school.

698
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:14,375
You're the one
that dropped out
when you were 19.

699

Something about
your jealousy, Max.

Will you guys stop?

701
00:38:19,918 --> 00:38:22,334

take a vote.

with the note.

to kick some game.
Right.

1018
00:58:02,626 --> 00:58:05,542
So I told the man,
next to the Goddamn man,

1019
00:58:05,626 --> 00:58:08,292
that I was the best man
for the job,
you know what I'm saying?

1020
00:58:08,375 --> 00:58:09,667
Yes.

1021
00:58:09,751 --> 00:58:12,292

he looks at me...

1022
00:58:12,375 --> 00:58:13,834
Hmm.

1023
00:58:13,918 --> 00:58:17,876

"You're hired."

1024
00:58:17,959 --> 00:58:19,584
Right there on the spot.

1025
00:58:19,667 --> 00:58:21,334

1026
00:58:21,417 --> 00:58:22,876
that he knew that I knew

1027
00:58:22,959 --> 00:58:26,751
that I... was... the man.

1028
00:58:27,375 --> 00:58:29,375

$80,000 a year

1064

willing to sacrifice

1065

(IMITATING) Huh?

1531
01:32:01,918 --> 01:32:04,417

for nine months,
went through

1532

that last shot, right?

get me a Lexus, all right?

The day she died.

See, I was the only one
at the hospital.

1573
01:33:54,292 --> 01:33:57,209
And Big Mama told me where
she stashed a lot of money
none of you all knew about.

1574
01:33:57,292 --> 01:33:58,876
So how much money
are you talking about?

1575

Beaucoup?

Maybe you could help me figure
out what to do with the dough.

the money from the will?

smartest in the family.

in my future?
Sure.

Do the right thing
for family?

1585
01:34:16,417 --> 01:34:17,709
Absolutely.

1586
01:34:17,792 --> 01:34:19,500
See, I figure
if you help me,

1587
01:34:19,584 --> 01:34:21,334
I can give you a third.

1588
01:34:21,417 --> 01:34:22,834
You know, like a fee.

1589
01:34:22,918 --> 01:34:25,334
A fee?
Yeah, a fee.

1590
01:34:25,417 --> 01:34:27,500
Then you could pay off
Big Mama's bills.

1591
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:29,250
So you won't
have to sell the house.

1592
01:34:29,334 --> 01:34:31,918
And I can give you
a percentage
if you help me invest it.

1593
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,542
Then maybe you can
use the money
to promote your new CD.

Have you told anybody
else about this?

1595
01:34:37,042 --> 01:34:39,292
No, but I'd be willing
to give you some of it.

1596
01:34:39,375 --> 01:34:42,167
Then you could
pay off Aunt Teri's loan.
Why don't you tell me...

Ahmad, what's going on?

1691
01:41:38,751 --> 01:41:40,834
How come everybody's here?

1692
01:41:40,918 --> 01:41:43,000
We just having
Sunday dinner.

1693
01:41:43,083 --> 01:41:44,751
Sunday dinner?

1694
01:41:44,834 --> 01:41:47,292
Yeah, Sunday dinner.
You know, we got some
chicken and dumplings,

1695
01:41:47,375 --> 01:41:50,125
some string beans,
catfish, some...

1696
01:41:55,042 --> 01:41:56,459
Not cool, Ahmad.

1697
01:41:57,876 --> 01:41:59,959
I'm out of here.
Faith!

1698
01:42:00,042 --> 01:42:01,751
Wait. Please, stay.

1699
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:04,751
Please?

1700
01:42:08,167 --> 01:42:09,292
AHMAD: Dear Lord,

1701
01:42:09,375 --> 01:42:11,709
thank you for allowing us
another day on Earth,

1702
01:42:11,792 --> 01:42:13,918
another day
to glorify your name

1703
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,792
and sanctify ourselves
with your mercy.

1704
01:42:16,876 --> 01:42:20,792
Lord, I'm grateful
that the people I love
most in the world

1705
01:42:20,876 --> 01:42:22,709
are here to celebrate life

1706
01:42:22,792 --> 01:42:26,209
and the lessons as it unfolds.

1707
01:42:26,292 --> 01:42:29,918
And let one of those lessons
be acceptance and love,

1708
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,876
so we can be a family again

1709
01:42:31,959 --> 01:42:34,542
and love each other
like we used to.

1710
01:42:34,626 --> 01:42:37,042
In Christ Jesus' name, amen.

1711
01:42:37,125 --> 01:42:38,250
Amen.
MAXINE: Amen.

1712
01:42:38,334 --> 01:42:40,667
REVEREND WILLIAMS: Amen.
Mm-mm-mm.

1713
01:42:40,751 --> 01:42:43,167
It's so good to be back here.
I missed this place.

1714
01:42:43,250 --> 01:42:45,042
I've got my favorite food.

1715
01:42:45,125 --> 01:42:46,334
You can't find this food
anyplace...

1716
01:42:46,417 --> 01:42:48,125
Well, I have a surprise
for everyone later,

1717
01:42:48,209 --> 01:42:51,459
but for now,
why don't we just eat?

1718
01:42:51,542 --> 01:42:53,709
I say amen to that.
ALL: Amen.

1719

01:43:25,083 --> 01:43:28,042
LEM: Everybody, um...
I got my job back.

1721
01:43:28,125 --> 01:43:29,667
BIRD: Oh,
that's good, Lem.

1722
01:43:29,751 --> 01:43:31,918
Congratulations.
BIRD: That's great.

1723
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,751
Yeah, they asked
a brother back to work,

1724
01:43:33,834 --> 01:43:36,167
because they know
I'm a good, strong,
skilled worker.

1725
01:43:36,250 --> 01:43:37,500
That's right.

1726
01:43:37,584 --> 01:43:39,417
So, how'd you get
out of jail, Lem?

1727
01:43:39,500 --> 01:43:41,292
To tell you the truth, man,
I don't even know.

1728
01:43:41,375 --> 01:43:42,792
Somebody talked
to somebody,

1729
01:43:42,876 --> 01:43:45,250
and the charges
got dropped.

1730
01:43:45,334 --> 01:43:46,876
Here I am.

1731
01:43:46,959 --> 01:43:49,375
Well, we glad to
have you home, brother.
Yes, sir.

1732
01:43:49,459 --> 01:43:52,459
That's right.
My boo is home.

1733
01:43:52,542 --> 01:43:57,167
Actually, I called a friend
of mine at the D.A.'s office
for a favor.

1734
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,083
I felt bad.

1735
01:44:05,167 --> 01:44:06,834
Well, you should
feel bad.

1736
01:44:06,918 --> 01:44:09,000
Because of you,
I had to spend
weeks in jail.

1737
01:44:09,083 --> 01:44:10,834
You should be thankful.

1738
01:44:10,918 --> 01:44:13,042
Now you can spend
some time and take care
of your pregnant wife.

1739
01:44:13,125 --> 01:44:14,417
BIRD: You know what, Teri?

1740
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:16,417
You need to mind your own
damn business, all right?

1741
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:18,250
Didn't nobody
ask you for your help.

1742
01:44:18,334 --> 01:44:19,584
You need to be worrying
about your husband

1743
01:44:19,667 --> 01:44:21,292
and why
he's sleeping with her.

1744
01:44:29,626 --> 01:44:32,417
Gee.
No, sit.

1745
01:44:32,500 --> 01:44:34,167
No, let her go
if she wants to.

1746
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:37,709
Teri, I'm sorry,
but she's always
running away.

1747
01:44:37,792 --> 01:44:40,083
You're family,
and we're going
to deal with this.

1748
01:44:43,792 --> 01:44:46,042
Baby, go get me some more peas
and take your sister with you.

1749
01:44:46,125 --> 01:44:48,083
BIRD: Always worrying about
somebody else's business.

1750
01:44:48,167 --> 01:44:50,334
You need to take care
of your own husband.

1751
01:44:54,209 --> 01:44:56,000
So, was that it, Miles?

1752
01:44:56,083 --> 01:44:58,334
I didn't take care of you?

1753
01:45:01,751 --> 01:45:04,542
You know,
we haven't been happy
for a long time now.

1754
01:45:09,918 --> 01:45:11,876
We used to have
so much fun.

1755
01:45:19,667 --> 01:45:21,709
I don't know what happened.

1756
01:45:25,792 --> 01:45:28,167
It seems that
everything I love...

1757
01:45:28,709 --> 01:45:29,918
I lose.

1758
01:45:36,834 --> 01:45:38,959
Well... Um...

(CLEARS THROAT)

1760
01:45:45,083 --> 01:45:47,542
Good luck with
Mother Joe's money.

1761
01:45:49,626 --> 01:45:50,751
M-mother Joe's money?

1762
01:45:50,834 --> 01:45:52,834
Yeah, what money?
What are you talking about?

1763
01:45:52,918 --> 01:45:55,375
Supposedly, Mama has some
large amount of money

1764
01:45:55,459 --> 01:45:56,709
stashed someplace
in the house

1765
01:45:56,792 --> 01:45:58,792
that she was saving
for Ahmad, and...

1766
01:45:58,876 --> 01:46:01,250
That's why
we're all here tonight.

1767
01:46:02,459 --> 01:46:03,542
Ahmad?

1768
01:46:03,626 --> 01:46:05,542
Get in here.
KENNY: Ahmad.

1769
01:46:07,459 --> 01:46:08,626
MAXINE: Right now.

1770
01:46:11,125 --> 01:46:14,334
Ahmad, where's this money
that Mother Joe supposedly
left you?

1771
01:46:15,959 --> 01:46:19,209
There isn't any money.
I made it all up.

1772
01:46:19,292 --> 01:46:20,626
MAXINE: You made it up?

1773
01:46:20,709 --> 01:46:23,250
Ahmad, what have I
told you about lying?

1774
01:46:23,334 --> 01:46:24,959
You know
better than that.

1775
01:46:25,042 --> 01:46:28,125
It's not my fault!
It's y'all's fault!

1776
01:46:28,209 --> 01:46:30,000
Y'all messed up the family!

1777
01:46:30,083 --> 01:46:31,667

(AHMAD CRYING)

1779
01:46:34,876 --> 01:46:39,042
Big Mama wanted me
to get everyone together
for a Sunday dinner.

1780
01:46:39,125 --> 01:46:40,792
But I didn't know
how to do that,

1781
01:46:40,876 --> 01:46:43,459
because all
y'all do is fight.

1782
01:46:43,542 --> 01:46:46,626
So I lied...
Lied about the money
so you'd come.

1783
01:46:48,292 --> 01:46:50,667
So we could be a family again.

1784
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,876
Y'all know that's
what Big Mama wanted.

1785

Baby...

1786
01:46:58,375 --> 01:46:59,876
Come here.

01:47:01,334 --> 01:47:02,667
It's okay.

1788
01:47:02,751 --> 01:47:04,334
You guys smell that?

1789

Smell what?

1790
01:47:06,209 --> 01:47:07,792
Smells like it's coming
from the kitchen.

1791
01:47:07,876 --> 01:47:09,542
You didn't mess
with the stove,
did you?

1792
01:47:09,626 --> 01:47:11,626
I'll go look.
